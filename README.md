Hi, I'm Joe (they/them)! I'm a software engineer from the UK.

### üõ†Ô∏è What are you working on?

* I'm currently building [Tetra](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra), a framework for making 2D games with Rust.
    * Sometimes I use it to make games of my own, which you can find on my [itch.io](https://17cupsofcoffee.itch.io/)!
* From time to time, I [write about code](https://www.seventeencups.net/) or [make music](https://soundcloud.com/17cupsofcoffee).

### üí¨ How can I get in touch with you? 

* I'm [@17cupsofcoffee on Twitter](https://twitter.com/17cupsofcoffee).
* You can also email me via joe (at) seventeencups (dot) net.
